# Login Application

## Description

This application is a login page featuring a form with fields for username and password. The form is controlled, meaning the user must input a valid email address format in the username field and a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters (@$!%\*#?&.+=<>:;) in the password field.

## Features

- **Form Validation**: The form validates that the username is a valid email address and that the password contains the required combination of characters.
- **Alert Messages**: If the username and password combination is incorrect, an alert with the message "the provided password is wrong" is displayed.
- **Credentials for Testing**: Login only works with the following credentials:
  - **Username**: test@luxpmsoft.com
  - **Password**: test1234

## Important Notes

- The application does not integrate with a backend or API.
- The credentials are for demonstration and testing purposes only.
